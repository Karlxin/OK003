1.Target:
this project is about to create the general artificial intelligence
		
2.realizing:	

3.problem:	1.the brain theory.we need more details about that.

4.reason:	 

5.todo:     1.create a reinforcement,supervised,unsupervised combination agent
            2.reinforcement should have time and error punishment,adventure and correct reward,which is responsible for short term tactics.
            this is somewhat the id.the subject.the humanity.the art.
            3.supervised learning should take of longer term memory and a structure of value,which is responsible for engineering problem.
            this is somewhat the ego.the project.the business.the technology.
            4.unsupervised learning should take of the longest term,which is responsible for the general problem.
            this is somewhat the superego.the object.the reason.the science.

5.Git
5.0.Avoiding Death
5.0.0.Old pattern may be important.We may just see the patterns instead of the reality.
5.1.Git Retrieve
5.1.0.Human synapses changing hard at ages,Nature give us death to avoid overfitting.
5.2.Git Merge
5.2.0.Merge let us combine two patterns group.
